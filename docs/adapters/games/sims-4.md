# Sims 4 creator, mod and custom-content ecosystem

[Adapter laboratory](../README.md) · [Identity, body, media and follow contract](../author-post-media-contract.md) · [Validation gate](../validation-and-adoption.md)

**Checked October 28, 2026 UTC (October 27 in America/Denver).** This pass records public first-party page inspection across 32 services/scopes, including creator-owned release sites and compatibility references. It does not establish 32 functioning adapters. The public subpass did not authenticate an account, change follows, download a mod binary or accept full extraction. A subsequent [Mod Collective browser fixture](../mod-collective.md) verified one signed-in free download, body extraction, three gallery images and the linked creator avatar.

## What the public inspection established

Sixteen services have detailed page observations below. Actual item and creator/profile routes were opened where exposed. Two content previews actually displayed: a SimsFinds JPEG and a SnootySims PNG. Link presence, page-readable text, media loading, authenticated access and accepted extraction are separate states. No video/GIF playback was validated. No creator-avatar decode was accepted in this public subpass; the subsequent Mod Collective receipt records a separate successful decode.

The attempted anonymous Python retrieval was denied before a response. This subpass therefore used retrieved first-party pages and small-field transcription. The field locations below identify observed headings, labels and links; they are **not guessed CSS selectors or embedded JSON paths**. A real parser must acquire permitted DOM/schema fixtures before implementation.

### High-value failures to preserve

- Mod Collective’s text retrieval exposed an Avatar image label whose observed URL ends in `.null`; that specific fetch failed. A later authenticated browser fixture decoded the sampled avatar, so this is a source-bound retrieval failure, not a universal avatar outage. Its visible `ImageObject.creator.name` strings name creations and cannot identify the human account.
- The MTS Creator image is a generic `paint.gif` role badge. The AML profile-adjacent Image link opened a theme pattern. A Simszoo post Image link opened a Sims logo. None is an author avatar.
- WCIF landing pages expose many search rows while `/creators` remains “Loading creators”; rows explicitly say “No Preview Image”. Index metadata is not an ingested creator post.
- SimsFinds post text includes Show More, a blank Published field in this retrieval, download wait text and a separate tracked Patreon link. A single preview loading does not establish complete content or downloads.
- Around the Sims returned Pharmacy/Drugstore body under a retrieval metadata title saying Nail salon furniture. TSR live index labels and returned creation identity also diverged. Preserve actual resolved IDs/URL/body identity.
- Simszoo download action redirects to MediaFire and failed there. Download record, outbound host and file binary are distinct objects.
- The Russian sims-new item visibly substitutes users-only notices for file regions; the homepage separately announces no more updates/support. Do not erase either limitation.

## Detailed public-page observations

## Login and access verification queue

Use the [secure interactive login workflow](../authenticated-research.md) for authorized account access. Exact item return URLs matter. A blocked guest fetch does not establish that login will help, and a login cannot override profile privacy or paid entitlement. Use existing authorized access; do not purchase access, bypass anti-bot/robots controls or move credentials into research files.

## Implementation decisions and rejected alternative

Prefer creator-origin content and retain every intermediary as a separate provenance node. A directory listing, reblog, uploader, original creator, project release and hosted file must not collapse into one author/post. Accept missing avatars explicitly. Keep `.package`, `.ts4script`, archives, sets, lots and dependencies separate from media. Preserve access state and publication/update/version fields independently.

Reject a universal title/thumbnail scraper as the default implementation: these observed pages contain excerpts, hidden regions, moving link identities, placeholders, external hosts, generic role icons and entitlement boundaries. Site-specific parsing costs more maintenance but can preserve complete accessible content and correct identity. The alternative remains acceptable only for an explicitly labeled discovery-only card that makes its partial state clear.

Use common platform adapters where evidence supports them: Tumblr for reblog provenance, WordPress for relevant independent sites, Invision for AML/LoversLab where permitted, and WoltLab for Simszoo. These are reuse candidates, not proof that one selector set works across installations. No API endpoint, rate limit, direct-file URL construction, native follow mutation or account import was invented.

Acceptance requires permitted real DOM/JSON fixtures, correct account/avatar mapping, complete accessible body and ordered media parity, full gallery/media loads, authorized file delivery, continuation/edit handling and access-boundary tests. Preserve the current target baseline; these findings alone do not justify target application changes.

## Source register identifiers

The machine-readable companion contains each primary source URL, observed title/retrieval result, original notes and detailed evidence. The following source IDs are included in the [source register](../../../data/sources.json); failed/shell sources remain registered as failures, not promoted to successful extraction:

SIMS001, SIMS002, SIMS003, SIMS004, SIMS005, SIMS006, SIMS007, SIMS008, SIMS009, SIMS010, SIMS011, SIMS012, SIMS013, SIMS014, SIMS015, SIMS016, SIMS017, SIMS018, SIMS019, SIMS020, SIMS021, SIMS022, SIMS023, SIMS024, SIMS025, SIMS026, SIMS027, SIMS028, SIMS029, SIMS030, SIMS031, SIMS032, SIMS033, SIMS034, SIMS035, SIMS036, SIMS037, SIMS038, SIMS039, SIMS040, SIMS041, SIMS042, SIMS043, SIMS044, SIMS045, SIMS046, SIMS047, SIMS048, SIMS049, SIMS050, SIMS051, SIMS052, SIMS053, SIMS054, SIMS055, SIMS056, SIMS057, SIMS058, SIMS059, SIMS060, SIMS061, SIMS062, SIMS063, SIMS064, SIMS065, SIMS066, SIMS067, SIMS068, SIMS069, SIMS070, SIMS071.

## Round two: concrete methods

[Cross-site method index](../methods-round2.md) · [Sanitized method evidence](../../../experiments/site-adapter-discovery/method-research-round2-2026-10-28.json). Source IDs with historical S2K/M2C/S2S prefixes are published as SKYB/MCB/SIMB; original IDs remain in the manifest.

Checked October 28, 2026 UTC. User-facing date: October 28, 2026 America/Denver.

This is an additive research handoff. It preserves the prior catalog and the stronger Mod Collective browser receipt. No shared repository file was changed by this pass.

**20 independent-site candidates**, including 14 with readable first-party pages; 17 inspected scopes; 18 implementation recipes; 75 source records. Two precise images displayed: one CurseForge-linked KimikoSoma profile avatar and one Ravasheen content preview. No authentication, account mutation, full extraction, binary validation or new adapter acceptance.

### Findings that change implementation

- Translation sites add valuable creator discovery and require separate original-author, translator, publisher and dependency roles. ModSims4's article links the translation project and KimikoSoma profile; the profile points back to the original site. Istolia independently separates original mod, translation, XML Injector and screenshot credits.
- Ravasheen's item needs the detailed sections after its short Description. The four gallery identities appear twice each, in source order 2, 4, 3, 1. Store placement order and distinct gallery identities separately.
- LittleMsSam and Sims4Me publish useful table-based catalogs. A project may be a row inside a category page; URL-only identity can collapse distinct mods. Preserve multiline module notes, required packs and named translator credits.
- BrazenLotus's flattened Wix page includes incompatible status templates together. Require visible-state evidence before assigning retired, broken, functional or coming-soon status.
- Scumbumbo's maintained site separates original author, named updater and maintenance group. Its current version 4.2 is distinct from the old MTS version 2 download.
- SimRealist separates news writer, team and project publisher. Its itch.io creator page also has collections of other creators' projects; collections are not ownership.
- PandaSama's public article, comment subscription, related paid diary and actual release page are separate scopes. A signed image returning 403 does not establish a paywall or prove expiry.
- WCIF still exposes search rows while its creator directory remains a loading shell. PlumbDex and TS4 Rebels fresh requests failed; earlier working evidence is retained.

### Concrete extraction recipes

No exact CSS class selector or embedded site data path was observed through this subagent's rendered-page transport. The recipes below give source-grounded boundaries, joins, file relations and validators. Suggested DOM selection and live API use require their own permitted fixture. Official WordPress field names are identified as documented, not as observed on a specific creator site.

#### sims4-translator-provenance

Article, author archive, original-release link, translation project, provider profile and avatar were inspected. Sources: SIMB002, SIMB003, SIMB004, SIMB005, SIMB006, SIMB012.

1. Create separate principals for the article author, translator, original mod creator and distributor.
2. Classify links by their observed section and label: original mod, translation, required library, screenshot credits or social support.
3. Follow the actual provider URL; preserve project 1309269 and its canonical redirect.
4. Associate cross-site identities only through observed links and role evidence; keep the avatar attached to its CurseForge account.

Validation:

- World Tour original creator is ThatssoJordy; translation owner is KimikoSoma.
- Istolia's original mod, translation, XML Injector dependency and screenshot credits remain separate relations.
- An author archive excerpt cannot satisfy full article extraction.
- A project logo cannot satisfy the avatar field.

Unresolved: WordPress numeric user identity, body container and live REST data remain unverified.

#### ravasheen-complete-item

The item has separate Description, Details, Change Log and Known Issues sections; four image identities appear twice each. Sources: SIMB015, SIMB016, SIMB017, SIMB018.

1. Capture the short description and detailed body separately, retaining the section tree through Known Issues.
2. Exclude global download, support and footer navigation.
3. Store all media occurrences and a separate gallery ordered by first occurrence; retain source order 2, 4, 3, 1.
4. Keep the version badge and each changelog date; resolve the actual Drive link at download time.

Validation:

- The sample has four distinct gallery identities and eight placements.
- Only the first PNG was displayed; the other three remain untested.
- Preserve version 1.0.2, initial date December 23, 2023 and changelog date March 18, 2024.
- The failed Drive redirect leaves attachment delivery unresolved.

Unresolved: No DOM parser, complete gallery or downloaded file was accepted.

#### lms-row-catalog

The rendered table exposes named columns, two download providers and multiline notes. Sources: SIMB019, SIMB020, SIMB021.

1. Locate the table by its header signature after obtaining a DOM fixture.
2. Map fields by header name and keep multiline notes within their own row.
3. Extract dated update events with locale and translator credit.
4. Use actual provider project URLs as identity evidence; retain the creator-site row as an alias.
5. Keep checked game patch, provider release date and historical profile patch separate.

Validation:

- Heat Up Leftovers maps to its actual followed CurseForge item.
- A translator mentioned in update notes does not become the mod creator.
- The declared 212 gameplay mods is a count target, not extraction proof.
- Blank DLC cells remain unknown unless their semantics are verified.
- The old itch.io patch 1.63.136 must not overwrite the current-site patch 1.129.39.

Unresolved: Full row parity, filter behavior, avatar and binaries remain untested.

#### brazenlotus-visible-status

Flattened text simultaneously exposes incompatible status labels; About explains required Core files and optional override modules. Sources: SIMB022, SIMB023, SIMB024.

1. Require a visible DOM or observed structured response to bind the active status to this item.
2. Retain contradictory raw labels as evidence and emit unknown status until visibility is established.
3. Capture Features, Details, Conflicts and required-file sections independently.
4. Separate mandatory Core dependencies, optional Core Modules and author/tool credits.

Validation:

- Reject a definitive status when retired, broken and functional labels all appear without visibility evidence.
- Core Modules must retain optional override semantics.
- IngredientTags_Enabler remains optional.
- Two script files do not imply two separate downloadable projects.

Unresolved: Wix visibility and actual structured schema remain unresolved.

#### scumbumbo-maintenance-lineage

The maintained page names Triplis; About describes community maintenance; the old MTS record points to that site. Sources: SIMB025, SIMB026, SIMB027, SIMB028, SIMB029.

1. Preserve Scumbumbo as original author and record updater and maintainer roles separately.
2. Link the old MTS project to the maintained release without merging file IDs.
3. Read current version 4.2 separately from historical version headings and updater notes.
4. Classify the player library ZIP and modder documentation ZIP separately.

Validation:

- Original author, named updater and maintenance group remain distinct.
- The old MTS version 2 file cannot be relabeled as version 4.2.
- Archive member listings stay nested under their archive.
- An unsupported ZIP response does not establish byte integrity.

Unresolved: Current ZIP hashes and complete history remain untested.

#### mts-identity-files-and-avatar

Numeric project/member routes, archive links, internal members and the actual custom-avatar link were observed. Sources: SIMB028, SIMB029, SIMB030.

1. Use the numeric project and member IDs from resolved links.
2. Capture Overview, Files, Information and comments separately; mark loading comments incomplete.
3. Enumerate downloadable archives, then nest the internal file table under the appropriate archive.
4. Use a profile-associated custom avatar, excluding creator badges and game icons.
5. Retain redirects, content type and load status for every avatar attempt.

Validation:

- There are two archives with different user/modder purposes.
- Member 7401825 joins the inspected creator profile.
- The custom avatar GIF failed retrieval; animation and decode remain unknown.
- Guest sign-in menus and Thanks labels do not prove an authenticated session.

Unresolved: DOM selectors, file integrity and avatar decode remain pending.

#### sfs-file-page

The small file page exposes a filename, size, uploader label, dates and an actual CDN Download link. Sources: SIMB031, SIMB032, SIMB001.

1. Extract file ID from the observed canonical download URL.
2. Map the metadata table by its labels; preserve uploader as a label if no profile exists.
3. Keep upload and update dates separate, with timezone unspecified when absent.
4. Follow only the actual Download href and preserve its redirect chain.
5. Retain the original creator-site link as provenance and classify the INI as a preset.

Validation:

- File 3692732 remains kimiko.ini with displayed size 26.0 kB.
- Uploader label kimikosoma does not establish a numeric account or avatar.
- The inaccessible download has no accepted checksum or bytes.
- A metadata-only file page does not become the original post body.

Unresolved: No binary, checksum, uploader profile or avatar was available.

#### istolia-body-media-relations

The article, about page, repeated cover, ordered screenshots, dependency and download labels were observed. Sources: SIMB012, SIMB013.

1. Capture the article and download explanation before previous/next links, partner widgets and cookie controls.
2. Preserve image occurrences and a separate distinct asset list.
3. Represent XML Injector, the original Patreon mod and the CurseForge translation as different relations.
4. Keep the credited house and hairstyle as screenshot provenance, not dependencies.

Validation:

- Partner cards cannot become article authors.
- Cloudinary screenshots cannot become avatars.
- Cookie policy text stays outside the body.
- The XML Injector dependency survives even if the original mod URL fails.

Unresolved: Original image variants and complete image loading remain untested.

#### candyman-unavailable-state

The article ends with an explicit unavailable-download statement before reactions, sharing and ad-block dialogs. Sources: SIMB007, SIMB008.

1. Use article dates rather than the current date in the site header.
2. End the body at the unavailable-download state.
3. Collect the six inline images in source order.
4. Preserve the translator credit while leaving the original author unresolved.

Validation:

- October 28, 2026 in the header does not replace the 2021 article date.
- No download is manufactured from a removed link.
- Ad-block graphics are excluded from the six content images.
- Unknown original authors remain unresolved.

Unresolved: No profile, avatar or file delivery was established.

#### simrealist-team-news-release

The patch-status post, team role page, actual FlowFit project and itch.io profile were opened. Sources: SIMB040, SIMB041, SIMB042, SIMB043, SIMB044.

1. Separate writer Nichole, the SimRealist organization, contributors and project publisher.
2. Bind compatibility assertions to exact game platform versions and the source date.
3. Follow the actual itch.io project for its body, files and devlog.
4. Keep creator Follow separate from Add To Collection and leave mixed guest relationship labels unresolved.
5. Distinguish owned projects from curated collections of other creators.

Validation:

- FlowFit ZIP version 0.3.1.4 matches the dated status assertion.
- A curated roBurky project does not become SimRealist-owned.
- A failed writer image cannot be replaced by an organization logo.
- A status post is source testimony, not independent compatibility testing.

Unresolved: No binary, account relationship read-back or complete history was tested.

#### seebee-inline-project-records

The actual item link resolves to a category table containing the target row, not a unique detail URL. Sources: SIMB045, SIMB046, SIMB047, SIMB048.

1. Use a real row ID if exposed; otherwise retain a provisional page-and-name identity with collision checks.
2. Extract the row's date, category and multiline description independently.
3. Expand public description controls in the eventual DOM fixture and retain module instructions.
4. Preserve language, sort and filter state in the receipt.
5. Keep the creator's freshness notice separate from historical row update dates.

Validation:

- Two rows under one URL cannot collapse into one item.
- The sabotagefix row retains its Obsolet category.
- An empty download column in text is an unresolved target.
- A row date cannot establish current patch compatibility when the creator warns that the site may lag.

Unresolved: Stable row IDs and actual download icon targets remain unverified.

#### pandasama-public-and-gated-boundaries

The public Art Deco body, gallery links, author redirect, related paid teaser and separate release page were inspected. Sources: SIMB049, SIMB050, SIMB051, SIMB052.

1. End the current article before comment subscriptions and related posts.
2. Keep publication date and public release date separate.
3. Retain both the author alias and its homepage redirect.
4. Keep signed media URLs in ephemeral runtime state; persist stable provenance and a sanitized failure.
5. Do not infer a paywall or expiry solely from a media 403.
6. Treat the separate mod release and backup download as another project scope.

Validation:

- A related paid teaser cannot mark the public current post locked.
- The image 403 has an unknown cause.
- An author redirect to home is not a complete author archive.
- The espresso machine's Get Together condition is not a mandatory condition for every item in the pack.

Unresolved: No signed preview decode or binary download was accepted.

#### simcredible-iframe-and-image-navigation

The parent page, actual iframe, team page and unsupported GIF target were inspected. Sources: SIMB033, SIMB034, SIMB035, SIMB036.

1. Treat the parent and public iframe as separate fragments with separate base URLs.
2. Resolve image anchors before deciding whether they identify media or an item detail.
3. Extract the dated iframe summary as an announcement only.
4. Use actual provider profile links for team identity and leave unlabeled portraits unresolved.
5. Classify decorative GIFs separately from content media and avatars.

Validation:

- The parent alone is incomplete because the iframe contains the dated summary.
- Unsupported image/gif does not establish animation playback.
- Unlabeled staff art does not identify a person.
- Click-picture instructions do not prove downloadable files.

Unresolved: Actual item detail and full catalog extraction still need a DOM fixture.

#### twistedmexi-master-blocks

The master list uses repeated mod headings, previews, descriptions, instructions and download links, plus early-access cards. Sources: SIMB072.

1. Pair each actual download link with its own semantic mod block.
2. Separate release-candidate early access from ordinary releases.
3. Preserve installation instructions per mod.
4. Treat previews as item media and use the existing Patreon adapter for the linked release body.
5. Keep shared Patreon targets explicit rather than inventing a binary per card.

Validation:

- All Cheats script installation differs from Better BuildBuy folder installation.
- A missing image cannot shift a download link into the previous card.
- The directory is not a complete Patreon history.
- External follow instructions retain Patreon semantics.

Unresolved: No independent detail page, full provider extraction or avatar was established.

#### simsfinds-bounded-source-card

The fresh item retains Show More controls and wait text; the profile exposes year filters from 2026 to 2020. Sources: SIMB053, SIMB054.

1. Key creation 407711 separately from profile sonyasims.
2. Capture both description regions and expand public Show More controls in the browser fixture.
3. Preserve the tracked Patreon link as an outbound reference without forwarding a site session.
4. Traverse actual year links with creation-ID deduplication and retain unvisited-year gaps.
5. Use a profile-associated avatar rather than an item preview.

Validation:

- Floating-hair prose does not establish a video asset.
- A blank Published value remains null.
- A wait/Premium label is not a completed download.
- Favorite lists and recommendations do not establish imported native follows.

Unresolved: Root browser evidence is required for complete body, avatar and download behavior.

#### wcif-shell-detection

The creator directory remains a loading shell while category pages expose search rows with explicit missing previews. Sources: SIMB055, SIMB056.

1. Emit separate capability states for search rows, creator directory and full post content.
2. Map only visible row labels until a real item/profile URL is observed.
3. Keep missing previews explicit.
4. Observe actual public hydration responses before choosing any API route.
5. Record access and source filters in the query receipt.

Validation:

- Loading creators prevents directory completeness.
- An advertised 10,000+ result total is not the extracted count.
- Shared-by names are not stable creator IDs.
- The presence of a sign-in link does not prove login is needed for public data.

Unresolved: No exact item/profile JSON schema was observed.

#### blocked-and-broken-retrieval-contract

Exact known routes and actual clicked detail/profile targets failed with different error classes. Sources: SIMB057, SIMB058, SIMB038, SIMB039, SIMB010.

1. Persist the attempted URL, resolved URL when known, source link, status and checked date.
2. Distinguish 404, inaccessible, restricted fetch, shell and policy denial.
3. Append a failed attempt without erasing stronger earlier observations.
4. Do not use alternate origins, proxies or raw requests to work around policy blocks.
5. Keep unresolved profile IDs provisional after a profile failure.

Validation:

- A failed detail does not count as a body extraction.
- A new PlumbDex failure does not erase prior specialist evidence.
- TS4 Rebels restricted fetch does not become login-required.
- Round two contains no LoversLab or F95 request.

Unresolved: Root owns legitimate authenticated browser access; no account mutations were performed.

#### conditional-wordpress-rest-reuse

Official WordPress schemas were read; actual site REST/feed probes did not produce usable responses. Sources: SIMB059, SIMB060, SIMB061, SIMB063, SIMB064, SIMB062.

1. Discover the actual API root and routes from permitted site evidence.
2. If a real post response is available, map documented id, link, author, content, excerpt, featured_media and GMT dates.
3. Resolve public author identity and avatar_urls only when a real user response is returned.
4. Use content rather than excerpt, then preserve ordered media and attachments from its HTML.
5. Discover custom post types from actual responses; do not assume every download is a core post.
6. Use real response pagination and terminal signals before marking history complete.

Validation:

- No REST success is claimed for the failed types probe.
- Documented avatar_urls is not an observed field on these specific sites.
- Featured media is neither the full gallery nor a creator avatar.
- Any nested rendered fields must be confirmed from the actual site's response.

Unresolved: Live site schemas, custom types and complete pagination remain unverified.

Documented WordPress fields, conditional on a real response: `WordPressPost.id`, `WordPressPost.link`, `WordPressPost.author`, `WordPressPost.content`, `WordPressPost.excerpt`, `WordPressPost.featured_media`, `WordPressPost.date_gmt`, `WordPressPost.modified_gmt`, `WordPressUser.id`, `WordPressUser.name`, `WordPressUser.link`, `WordPressUser.slug`, `WordPressUser.avatar_urls`.

### Exact public and gated access targets

| Target | Why it matters |
|---|---|
| [SimsFinds item 407711](https://www.simsfinds.com/downloads/407711/robin-hair-right-sims4) and [SonyaSims](https://www.simsfinds.com/sonyasims) | Root can verify Show More, profile avatar, date, actual download and year-scoped history. |
| [TwistedMexi Better Exceptions RC1](https://www.patreon.com/TwistedMexi/posts/better-v3-17-rc1-158788471) | Guest explicitly locked; ZIP filename visible. Compare only legitimate existing entitlement. |
| [PandaSama diary](https://www.pandasama.com/modding-diary-pleading-forgiveness-adopting-foster-baby/) | Guest main body absent; actual browser needed to distinguish rendering from a Patreon-linked gate. |
| [World Tour Band Module](https://www.patreon.com/thatssojordy/posts/world-tour-mod-1-143703086) | Public guest body and attachment observed; historical early-access badge does not require login today. |

No LoversLab or F95 request was made in this round; the earlier browser site-safety policy blocks remain in force.

### WCIF browser follow-up: index hydration resolves, original body remains unknown

A later guest browser fixture rendered the creator directory as100rows with11headers and the actual RIMINGS profile14342 as885items/1,745public favorites. One normal Load More expanded50item links to100unique links with the initial prefix preserved; more remained available. Creator avatar is absent, with only an initial-R fallback. Explicit Tumblr and Patreon links are provenance claims. [BRR010] [BRR011]

The exact Weekend Escape index item exposes `h1`, `section[aria-label="Item details"]`, creator14342 and source Patreon172243497. Its88-character generated DigitalDocument description is not the original post body. One267×267 preview decoded, with signed query values excluded. Complete original body/gallery, files, entitlement and native follows remain untested. This resolves the narrow rendered-index gap without erasing earlier shell observations. [BRR012]
