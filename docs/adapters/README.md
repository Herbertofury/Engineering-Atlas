# Adapter laboratory

**Repository synchronization pending:** this research pass is published through the wiki. Its updated canonical files and new executable-lab files have not yet been uploaded to `main`, so new repository-only code and receipt links may not yet resolve. The wiki retains the reviewed methods and their limits in full.

**Collect real data. Preserve source identity. Prove complete media and responsive cards together.**

Research and implementation status are separate. A platform listing is not proof that all pages, paid content or media work. Existing adapters and maintained upstream tools are baselines, not disposable scaffolding.

## Expanded research: 349 service and scope entries

Reviewed **October 31, 2026 UTC**, retaining dated October 28 evidence. The [coverage catalog](coverage-catalog.md) spans mod hosts, paid creator platforms, social networks, regional communities, blogs, code forges, file hosts and specialist indexes. The first six-game expansion reached 248 entries; the second added 98 canonical services/scopes, bringing that dated snapshot to **346**. The October 31 screenshot review adds Pawchive, Tipeee and historical HYPAGE as researched candidates, bringing current coverage to **349**; [the per-site matrix](paid-platforms.md#screenshot-coverage-and-operation-evidence--october-31) retains unresolved Library and explicit operation gates. The [new extraction methods](methods-round2.md) retain 71 game/cross-game recipes, five additional browser scopes, actual failures, field boundaries and remaining gates. Every entry has operation-specific evidence status; a catalog entry does not imply complete support.

The [executable extraction lab](../../experiments/site-extraction-lab/README.md) replays nine real captured fixtures through eight parser families, producing 27 normalized records with sanitized receipts. Authenticated checks now include [Mod Collective](mod-collective.md), [SubscribeStar](subscribestar.md) and [Patreon](patreon.md). Actual browser downloads are verified for a public Patreon release and [SimsFinds](simsfinds.md), alongside the earlier Mod Collective fixture. Member-only bodies, complete histories and native follow operations remain separately gated.

The catalog includes LoversLab, Planet Minecraft, The Sims Resource, Mod The Sims, SimsFinds, SimsDom, Sims File Share, Mod Collective, Daymarr, Nexus Mods, CurseForge, Modrinth, mod.io, Thunderstore, Bethesda Creations, Hangar, SpigotMC, BuiltByBit, Polymart/voxel.shop, ModDB, Hytale sources, Patreon, FANBOX, Fantia, Boosty, Afdian, Ko-fi, Gumroad, itch.io, BOOTH, Ci-en, Fourthwall and many more. Cross-game creators require separate Skyrim SE, Fallout 4, Minecraft, Sims 4, Hytale and Cyberpunk 2077 fixtures; a shared domain does not establish every game/file format.

## What a complete author-following app needs

- Stable creator identity, correct profile image and reversible links between the creator's own accounts; uploader, team, translator and reblogger roles preserved.
- Complete accessible post body, ordered images/video/audio, captions, edits, external embeds and distinct download attachments.
- Project/release/file identity, version and game/loader compatibility, dependencies, provenance and entitlement-aware delivery.
- Separate local follows, source follows, follow-list imports, project watches, notification settings and paid memberships.
- Resumable history, edit/removal detection, honest partial results, account-scoped caches, expiry recovery and measured rate control.

The [author, post, media and follow contract](author-post-media-contract.md) defines these requirements. The [login workflow](authenticated-research.md) describes protected sign-in and account-specific fixtures. The [validation and adoption gate](validation-and-adoption.md) defines what must be proven before an implementation or a GameSync Next change is accepted.

## Next proof work

1. Expand the retained samples into complete acceptance corpora, including edited/deleted posts, multi-page histories, missing or incorrect creator joins, animated media and expiring files. The current Modrinth, WordPress/RSS, Tumblr DOM and specialist-site observations provide concrete starting points; API/NPF parity remains a separate check.
2. Use authorized member fixtures to compare guest, signed-in nonmember and entitled states. Patreon and SubscribeStar sign-in succeeded, but that does not establish paid access. Follow-list imports and native writes require their own evidence; creator administration APIs do not automatically expose a patron's subscriptions.
3. Resolve each remaining operation using the catalog's evidence state and the same acceptance corpus. Where a site permits only embeds, links or creator-installed integrations, expose that capability accurately. Preserve policy-blocked and failed results instead of calling them working adapters.

Each provider keeps its actual review date and source status. The [wiki projection instructions](wiki-sync.md) keep this source and the wiki aligned without overwriting unrelated pages.

## Promotion rule

General results stay here. Only verified improvement against a target project's current implementation earns a recommendation in that project's wiki/TODO. No new project recommendations were made from generated card or storage workloads.

## Real-media workbench

[Open the public media laboratory](https://herbertofury.github.io/Engineering-Atlas/media-lab/) for real source snapshots, image decode and explicit player states. [Retained browser evidence](../../experiments/real-media-lab/README.md) distinguishes working Steam playback, delayed YouTube playback with a failed thumbnail, and unknown gallery coverage.
