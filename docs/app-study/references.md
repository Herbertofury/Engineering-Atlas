# Article references, examples and claims to keep separate

[Study guide](README.md) · [Tool inventory](tools.md) · [Practical workflows](workflows.md)

The article blends tools, inspiration, products being studied and launch anecdotes. Keep those roles separate: a popular example is not a dependency, a gallery is not an asset license, and a vendor result is not a local benchmark.

## Example applications and upstream projects

| Named item | Source | What to learn; limits |
|---|---|---|
| OpenCursor / open-cursor | [Upstream](https://github.com/Noah-Thing/open-cursor) | Example open editor built on Code-OSS. Study module boundaries and own-account model integrations. MIT project statements do not cover every bundled asset, extension or service. Not a required RE tool. |
| Code-OSS | [VS Code source](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode) | Underlying editor codebase named in the OpenCursor example. Source license, Microsoft's branded binary and extension marketplace access are distinct. |
| OpenMausBot | [Upstream](https://github.com/milind-soni/OpenMausBot) | Example agent-chat application; inspect isolation and per-agent authorization boundaries. Apache-2.0 upstream; external agents/services retain their terms. Not permission to connect accounts. |
| Open CoDesign / open-codesign | [Upstream](https://github.com/OpenCoworkAI/open-codesign) | Example prompt-to-design application. MIT upstream; credential import and generated content rights need separate review. The article does not supply an owner-qualified link, so this is the matching primary project found during review. |
| ArtCraft | [Official suite](https://getartcraft.com/) | Example creative-tool suite and Craft Anything's broader context. Check each app's own status, terms and assets rather than applying one suite-wide license. |
| ArtCraft applications visible in the embedded suite image | [Official app directory](https://getartcraft.com/apps) | PhotoCraft, VectorCraft, FilmCraft, LightCraft, PdfCraft, EffectCraft, DesignCraft and FigCraft are example image/vector/video/photo/PDF/motion/layout/interface tools, not dependencies required to study an app. Lower rows in the capture are cut off; do not infer full names from partial tiles. |
| TwinDesk | [Upstream](https://github.com/inukaasith/twindesk) | The author's cited starting repository for DuoDesk. GPL-2.0 shown in the capture; check the exact forked revision and obligations before distributing a derivative. Compatibility identifiers belong in a keep-list. |
| Cleanly, DuoDesk, Hop/HopDrop, Bastion | [Author's project index](https://beyond-media.ai/projects) · [GitHub profile](https://github.com/0xCodez) | Author examples for cleanup, desk sharing, transfer and network observation. Their launch numbers and safety claims are not reproduced Atlas results. See the exact article landing links below. |
| Motion Atlas, Motion Library, Roadster City-style game | Same article / author index | Named examples or prompt scenarios for reference curation and original game creation. “Motion Atlas” is the author's example, not this Engineering Atlas repository. No independently verified repository is assigned here. |
| Cloudflare's Next.js rebuild | [Cloudflare's original account](https://blog.cloudflare.com/vinext/) | The linked primary account describes Vinext; cost/build/bundle figures are scoped publisher reports. They do not prove the article's general “any app” promise or justify an Atlas stack migration. |

Author-provided example landing pages, retained as examples rather than an install recommendation:

- [Cleanly](https://getcleanly.vercel.app/)
- [DuoDesk](https://getduodesk.vercel.app/)
- [Bastion](https://bastion-wifi.vercel.app/)
- [HopDrop](https://hop-drop.vercel.app/)

The article's comparison targets are [CleanMyMac](https://macpaw.com/cleanmymac), [AirDrop](https://support.apple.com/airdrop), [TeamViewer](https://www.teamviewer.com/), [AnyDesk](https://anydesk.com/), [Cursor](https://cursor.com/), Claude Design, [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and Apple-like visual polish. Naming them does not grant inspection, account, brand or asset rights, and no current price claim is adopted here. Grok Bot is an example-product comparison; it is not an instruction to contact another agent.

## Design and motion references

| Article link | Role and bounded use | Review state |
|---|---|---|
| [Refero styles](https://styles.refero.design/) | Style/reference library; record generalized layout/token observations and make an original identity. | Primary page read. |
| [Inspora](https://www.inspora.design/) | Visual design archive; compare a few relevant examples. Saving/account features may require sign-in. | Primary page read. |
| [60fps](https://60fps.design/) | UI/motion references; note states, timing and interaction context. | Primary page read. |
| [Bencho](https://bencho.dev/) | Interactive component/micro-interaction references; inspect an individual component's license before reusing code. | Primary page read; blanket component license not established. |
| [Recent](https://recent.design/) / [launch videos](https://recent.design/launch-videos) | Launch/reference curation; make original shot breakdowns rather than copying footage. | Homepage and launch navigation read. |
| [Layers](https://www.getlayers.ai/) | Website/3D scene prompt/reference library; verify paid access and template rights. | Primary page read; not all access established free. |
| [Motionin](http://motionin.design/) | Article's motion-reference link. | HTTPS retrieval failed; availability/content unverified, not declared dead. |
| [Beyond Media AI web design](https://beyond-media.ai/aiweb-design) | Author's design-reference page. | Retrieval failed; retain as article link, not verified guidance. |
| [Launch Videos: agents](https://launchvideos.gallery/category/agents) | Categorized launch films; study structure and pacing, not copy assets. | Primary page read. |
| [Rent My Header launch videos](https://rentmyheader.com/launch-videos) | Article's additional launch-film collection. | Retrieval failed; availability/content unverified. |
| [snapcn](https://snapcn.dev/) | Component demos as well as the tool in the inventory. | Primary page read; no need to count it twice. |

Viewing a page is not permission to scrape at scale, export private content, reproduce logos, redistribute fonts or reuse music/voices. Follow an example back to its original creator and inspect the exact rights.

## Corrections and unsupported leaps

1. **Runtime/version drift:** REA's current Node requirements and Craft Anything's engine counts differ from the article. Preserve the article as historical context, use the chosen release's docs for execution.
2. **Installer breadth:** REA now documents choosing agent registrations and reviewing changes; do not interpret the article as permission for every detected client. Native providers and GhidraMCP are separate integrations.
3. **Read-only ambiguity:** renaming functions changes an analysis database; runtime capture executes/controls processes. Neither is the same as static file reading.
4. **Clean-room overclaim:** folder separation, a flag and duplicate-string checks do not establish legal independence. Retain provenance and a behavior-only handoff; obey exact licenses and contracts.
5. **Incomplete snippets:** Playwright needs a usable local import/browser setup and output folders; `networkidle` is not universal readiness. The native Java post-script and workflow orchestration runtime are not fully supplied.
6. **License/cost claims:** GSAP has a custom license, Remotion has license eligibility rules, IDA editions differ, Rive/Jitter exports depend on current plans, and voice/hosting/database use can incur charges. Free source code does not make every dependency or service free.
7. **Privacy/counters:** hashed IP plus user agent is not automatically anonymous; cookie-free does not settle consent/notice law. The sample omits visitor-key expiry. A download redirect is not proof of a completed install. Rate limiting, retention, authentication and failure handling need a real design.
8. **Performance/safety anecdotes:** “3 hours 12 minutes,” 10+ apps, 13K installs, star counts, 3→61 fps, reviewer scores, safety findings and launch traffic are author-reported snapshots. No target baseline, full evidence set or independent reproduction was supplied here.
9. **Model slogans:** “Claude can't watch video” is not a universal model capability statement; contact sheets are a practical evidence format, not proof of a model limitation. Model naming and claimed throughput are not an Atlas benchmark.
10. **Publishing:** a successful CI build, `--publish never`, or a local wiki copy does not prove a public release, production site or wiki update. Each destination must be independently verified.
